For completeness, let me just note that the same thing can be achieved using `Theory` and `InlineData`.

I have included an example in this repository [here](https://github.com/kilfour/QuickTestr/blob/main/QuickTestr.Tests/Examples/DantesCalculator/CalculatorCharacterizationTests.cs).

The `Theory` version works, but it scales poorly.

Every new business rule increases the number of combinations we should test,
which quickly turns into an explosion of hand-written examples.

With property-based testing we describe the *shape* of valid data once,
and the engine continuously explores new combinations automatically.

That makes it particularly effective for legacy systems with many interacting rules,
where the real bugs tend to hide in unexpected edge-case combinations.
